- Installation details:
    - Create config files from _example files in `config` folder
    - Ensure volume paths in `docker-compose.yml` point at the correct host and container folders
    - Production-ready steps:
        - Add a valid SSL certificate as `ssl/cert.pem` and a matching private key as `ssl/key.pem`
        - Configure SSH for Git repositories in `ssh_config` and add identity files matching it into `ssh` folder.
    - run `docker-compose build` in root folder containing `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
    
- Running in Production
    - Start api using `docker-compose up -d`
    - Please note that the default port is 8000, this can be changed in `docker-compose.yml`
    - API can then be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000 OR https://127.0.0.1:8000 if SSL was enabled
    
- Manually testing the API without Docker, using a python virtualenv
    - `source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate` or `/path/to/virtualenv/Scripts/activate_this.bat` on Windows
    - `pip install --upgrade -e .`
    - `export FLASK_APP=/path/to/sls_api` or `set FLASK_APP=/path/to/sls_api` on Windows
    - `export FLASK_DEBUG=1` or `set FLASK_DEBUG=1`on Windows to activate DEBUG mode
    - By using the user `test@test.com` with the password `test`, access to all projects in granted in DEBUG mode
    - `flask run` - note that this uses port 5000 by default
    - These commands are contained within the `start-standalone.sh` script, so you can start the API by running `./start-standalone.sh` on UNIX-like systems.
